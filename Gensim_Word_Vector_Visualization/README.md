Core Operations

Loading Word Vectors
Downloads a pre-trained GloVe model that maps words into a 100-dimensional vector space.

Vector Extraction
Converts human-readable words into numerical vectors that machines can understand and process.

#Similarity Analysis
Identifies words with the closest semantic distance to a target word
(e.g., "banana" → similar to "fruit").

Vector Arithmetic
Solves linguistic analogies using vector math
(e.g., King − Man + Woman ≈ Queen).

Pattern Recognition
Evaluates the model’s understanding of semantic and syntactic relationships such as:

Capital cities

Cultural associations

Grammatical tenses
