Core Operations

1) Loading Word Vectors

Loads a pre-trained GloVe model with 100-dimensional word embeddings.

2) Vector Extraction

Converts words into numerical vectors for machine processing.

3) Similarity Analysis

Finds semantically similar words
(e.g., "banana" → "fruit")

4) Vector Arithmetic

Solves analogies using vector math
(King − Man + Woman ≈ Queen)

5) Pattern Recognition

Recognizes relationships like:

Capital cities

Cultural associations

Grammatical tenses
